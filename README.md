Good day, Please enter loadshedding doc and kindly find Loadshedding.java and download to your desktop.

To run the file:
* First create a folder and save the file on your desktop for easy access.
* When in the folder of the saved Loadshedding java, click on the URL bar at the top where the name of the folder appears and type in'cmd'
* This accesses the command line prompt while ensuring the pathing is correct
* Type in: "javac Loadshedding.java" to access the java compiler.(I've also uploaded the class file)
* Once the class file is in the folder type in: "java Loadshedding" to initiate the program.
* From here simply enter your region (1 - 16) to find corresponding loadshedding times.
* Once done, type: "Exit" to end program.
